# Cryptocurrencies
Module 19: Unsupervised Learning and Crypto

___

## Purpose 
__

The purpose of the respository is to use unsupervised learning so as to clean, transform and fit data by clustering and by using principal component analysis {PCA} so as to reduce the variables and thus attempt to simplify the analysis which can then be used to provide meaningful visualizations.

This assignment consists of four technical analysis parts as follows:

- Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Description of cryptocurrency project

This project attemots to provide a report that includes the cryptocurrencies being traded and their grouping to create a classification system for a major new client. The investment bank can also use the same data to make offers/advise groups of clients accordingly.

Below were some of the areas explored.
### Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
#### Coins Mined
